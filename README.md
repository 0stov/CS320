How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Clear user needs, and thorough testing. Esure what I'm aiming for is what the customer needs. The testing ensures what I'm aiming for is what I've actually built. If I think of any edge cases as I'm building the program I'll at least make notes so I can build a test later. Peer reviewed having a QS team, and/or automated testing will help ensure the code comes out as bug-free and functional as possible. Finally, testing by the people requesting the software ensures what I am building is what they expect. Sometimes customers don't know how to word what they want and ask for what they don't need. Constant communication/testing with the customer is ideal.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Ideally user needs are presented clearly to me with example inputs/outputs or example UX before I even begin. Barring clear instruction, I try to picture things from the perspective of the user. What are they trying to get by asking me to code this? What experience do they want me to have? Clear instruction is vital. If I am at all unclear about what they want from me, I would have a conversation about what is needed with clear examples with which I can test. I can then build tests based on what the user expects from my code and build from there.

How do I approach designing software?
 I approach software design by first laying out what is required by the software I will create. I spend as much time on this part as I can afford as I believe it's the most important. Creating tests that my code can perform the required tasks is second priority. After that, all it takes is to implement the requirements. If I spend enough time on design, I will already know how things will work and how each part will interact.
